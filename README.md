HI!  I'm Asher,
I am started to learn Python a few months ago, and I am interested in mastering it.  After I master Python I want to master C and C++ as well as Java.  I also want to learn some
Assembly langague as well, but one thing at a time.

I am looking for people to learn with, people to bounce ideas off of, and fresh eyes to look at my code when it doesn't work and vice verse.  
You can email me at greena@rogers.com.
