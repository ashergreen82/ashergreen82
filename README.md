👋 Hi, I’m Asher!

I’m a full-stack developer who has been hooked on programming since I was a kid and a few years ago, I decided to go all in and turn that lifelong passion into a career. These days, you’ll find me writing JavaScript (React), Python, and even dabbling in C# and Go. 🚀

I’ve built everything from chat apps to Star Wars character explorers (yes, the Force is strong with this one). My latest adventure? Mapping community garage sales on Google Maps — because who doesn't love a good bargain hunt? 🗺️✨

I love clean code, debugging weird errors, and building cool stuff with friendly teams. When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning something new or refining my Git game (git push, not push-ups).

Check out my projects below — and if you like what you see, let's connect!
